# Natural Language Querying Enhancement - Recommendations & Next Steps

## Executive Summary

I've successfully completed **Step 1 (Data Ingestion Module)** of the Natural Language Querying enhancement for your flight analyzer RAG system. The implementation provides a solid foundation for semantic search over uploaded flight data with the following capabilities:

‚úÖ **Completed:**
- Multi-format file reading (CSV, Excel, Parquet)
- Three-level embedding strategy (row, column, summary)
- Hybrid retrieval system (KB + uploaded data)
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion for result merging
- Upgraded to `text-embedding-3-large` for higher quality
- Comprehensive testing with your sample flight data

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The OpenAI API is returning 404 errors, which needs to be addressed by configuring a valid API key.

## Critical Next Step: Configure OpenAI API

### Issue

The system is encountering a 404 error when calling the OpenAI API:
```
Error processing batch 1: Error code: 404 - {'status': 'not found'}
```

### Solution

You need to create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenAI API key:

```bash
# Create .env file
cd /home/ubuntu/enhance_flight_analyzer_rag
cp .env.template .env

# Edit .env and add your API key
nano .env
```

**Required configuration:**
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
OPENAI_EMBED_MODEL=text-embedding-3-large
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo
```

### Alternative: Use Local Embeddings

If you don't want to use OpenAI, the system can fall back to local `sentence-transformers`:

```python
# The system will automatically use local embeddings if OPENAI_API_KEY is not set
# Install sentence-transformers if not already installed
pip install sentence-transformers
```

**Note:** Local embeddings will have different dimensions (384 vs 3072) and may require re-ingesting data.

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

1. **Configure OpenAI API Key**
   - Add valid API key to `.env` file
   - Test embedding generation
   - Re-ingest sample data with actual embeddings

2. **Validate Retrieval Quality**
   - Test semantic search with real embeddings
   - Evaluate retrieval accuracy
   - Tune RRF weights if needed

3. **Prepare for Step 2**
   - Review the enhanced LLM tools specification
   - Identify priority tools for your use case
   - Prepare additional test data if needed

### Step 2: Enhanced LLM Tools (Week 2-3)

**Priority Tools to Implement:**

1. **`read_uploaded_file`** - Essential for data preview
2. **`query_data_embeddings`** - Core functionality for NL querying
3. **`generate_pivot_table`** - High-value for flight data analysis
4. **`compute_aggregations`** - Essential for statistical queries
5. **`find_similar_records`** - Useful for pattern matching
6. **`filter_data`** - Necessary for complex queries

**Implementation Approach:**
- Start with `read_uploaded_file` and `query_data_embeddings`
- Add table generation tools next
- Integrate with existing `ToolEnabledLLM` class
- Test each tool individually before integration

### Step 3: UI Integration (Week 4)

**Components to Add:**

1. **File Upload Interface**
   - Drag-and-drop file upload
   - File preview and validation
   - Ingestion progress indicator

2. **Enhanced Query Interface**
   - Source selection (KB, Data, Hybrid)
   - Advanced options (detail level, top-k, etc.)
   - Query history

3. **Result Display**
   - Structured answer sections
   - Generated tables with export
   - Citations from multiple sources
   - Confidence scores

### Step 4: Query Understanding (Week 5)

**Optional Enhancement:**

If you find that queries are not being routed correctly or tool selection is suboptimal, implement the Query Understanding module:

- Intent classification
- Entity extraction
- Execution planning

**Note:** This can be deferred if the LLM's native tool-calling works well enough.

## Integration with Existing System

### How to Use the New Modules

**1. In the Report Assistant Page (`pages/02_Report_Assistant.py`):**

```python
# Add file upload section
from components.data_ingest import DataIngestor

st.subheader("üìÅ Upload Flight Data")
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload CSV or Excel", type=["csv", "xlsx", "parquet"])

if uploaded_file:
    # Save temporarily
    temp_path = f"/tmp/{uploaded_file.name}"
    with open(temp_path, "wb") as f:
        f.write(uploaded_file.getbuffer())
    
    # Ingest
    ingestor = DataIngestor()
    with st.spinner("Processing and embedding..."):
        result = ingestor.ingest_file(temp_path, uploaded_file.name)
    
    if result["status"] == "success":
        st.success(f"‚úÖ Ingested {result['row_count']} rows")
    else:
        st.error(f"‚ùå {result['message']}")
```

**2. In Query Handling:**

```python
from components.rag.hybrid_retrieval import HybridRetriever

# Initialize retriever
retriever = HybridRetriever()

# Query both KB and data
results = retriever.retrieve_hybrid(
    query=user_query,
    k=10,
    sources=["kb", "data"],
    weights={"kb": 0.4, "data": 0.6}  # Prioritize uploaded data
)

# Use results in LLM prompt
context = "\n\n".join([
    f"[{r['source_type'].upper()}] {r['text']}"
    for r in results
])
```

**3. In Tool-Enabled LLM:**

```python
# Add new tool for querying data
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "query_uploaded_data",
        "description": "Search uploaded flight data using natural language",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "query": {"type": "string"},
                "k": {"type": "integer", "default": 5}
            }
        }
    }
}

# Tool handler
def _handle_query_uploaded_data(arguments):
    retriever = HybridRetriever()
    results = retriever.retrieve_from_data(
        query=arguments["query"],
        k=arguments.get("k", 5)
    )
    return {"results": results}
```

## Cost Considerations

### OpenAI API Costs

**Text-embedding-3-large pricing (as of 2024):**
- ~$0.00013 per 1K tokens
- Typical flight data row: ~100 tokens
- 10,000 rows: ~$0.13

**For your sample data (54 rows):**
- Row embeddings: ~$0.001
- Column embeddings (45 cols): ~$0.001
- Summary: ~$0.0001
- **Total: < $0.01 per file**

**Recommendations:**
- Use summary-only strategy for initial testing
- Use hybrid strategy for production
- Implement caching to avoid re-embedding
- Consider batch processing for large datasets

---

## Known Issues and Workarounds

### Issue 1: OpenAI API 404 Error

**Cause:** Invalid or missing API key, or incorrect endpoint

**Workaround:**
1. Verify API key is correct
2. Check if API key has proper permissions
3. Ensure no firewall/proxy issues
4. Try using local embeddings as fallback

### Issue 2: Units Row in Flight Data

**Cause:** Many flight data files have a units row (e.g., "DGC", "%", "g")

**Workaround:**
```python
# When reading flight data, skip units row
df = pd.read_csv(file_path, skiprows=[1])
```

**Future Enhancement:** Auto-detect and handle units rows

### Issue 3: Large File Performance

**Cause:** Embedding 100K+ rows can be slow and expensive

**Workaround:**
- Use sampling (uniform or random)
- Limit to 10K rows by default
- Use summary-only strategy for very large files

### Issue 4: Mixed Data Types

**Cause:** Some columns have mixed types (numeric + text)

**Workaround:**
- Use `pd.to_numeric(errors='coerce')` to handle mixed types
- Document which columns were coerced
